  An invocation:

  An invocation runs an agent until it does not request to transfer to another
  agent.

    1. Is handled by agent.run().

  An LLM agent call is an agent with a BaseLLMFlow.
  An LLM agent call can contain one or multiple steps.

  An LLM agent runs steps in a loop until:
    1. A final response is generated.
    2. The agent transfers to another agent.
    3. The end_invocation is set to true by any callbacks or tools.

  A step:
    1. Calls the LLM only once and yields its response.

  The summarization of the function response is considered another step, since
  it is another llm call.
  A step ends when it's done calling llm and tools, or if the end_invocation
