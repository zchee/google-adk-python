  """Reconstructs workflow node states from session events.

  Scans session events in two passes to rebuild node states for
  non-resumable HITL resume:

  Pass 1: Collect all function response IDs from user events — these tell
  us which interrupts have been resolved.

  Pass 2: Scan non-user events for workflow node activity:
  - Data outputs (event.output) → node produced output
  - Interrupt IDs (event.long_running_tool_ids) → node was interrupted
  - Dynamic metadata (source_node_name, parent_execution_id) → node was
    dynamically scheduled

  For each tracked node, cross-reference its interrupt IDs against the
  resolved set from pass 1:
  - Unresolved interrupts → WAITING
  - No unresolved interrupts + has data → COMPLETED

  Returns the reconstructed node states only if at least one node is
  WAITING — otherwise returns None so the workflow starts fresh.

  Args:
    session_events: The list of session events to scan.
    current_invocation_id: The current invocation ID to skip.
    workflow_path: The workflow agent path for filtering direct children.
    graph: The workflow graph containing nodes and edges.

  Returns:
    A dict of node_name → NodeState if interrupted nodes exist, else None.
