  """Fills in standard metadata fields on an event if not already set.

  Fields that are already set on the event are not overwritten.

  Only ``invocation_id`` and ``node_path`` are filled from ``ctx``
  automatically.  Other fields (``author``, ``execution_id``, ``branch``)
  are only set when explicitly requested — they have no safe default
  derivable from ``ctx`` alone (e.g. nested workflows need the parent's
  name, not ``ctx.agent.name``).

  Args:
    event: The event to enrich (mutated in place).
    ctx: The invocation context providing default values.
    author: If provided, sets the event author when missing.
    node_path: Override for the node path. Falls back to ``ctx.node_path``.
    execution_id: If provided, sets the execution ID when missing.
    branch: If True, sets the event branch from ``ctx.branch`` when missing.

  Returns:
    The same event instance.
