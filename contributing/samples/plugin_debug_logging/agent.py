"""Sample agent demonstrating DebugLoggingPlugin usage.

This sample shows how to use the DebugLoggingPlugin to capture complete
debug information (LLM requests/responses, tool calls, events, session state)
to a YAML file for debugging purposes.

Usage:
  adk run contributing/samples/plugin_debug_logging

After running, check the generated `adk_debug.yaml` file for detailed logs.
