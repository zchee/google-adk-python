# ADK Workflow Nested Workflow Sample

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to compose workflows by embedding one workflow inside another as a single node in **ADK Workflows**.

It takes a 4-digit year as input and performs two tasks in parallel:

1. **Historical Event (`find_historical_event`)**: A straightforward Agent node that generates a 2-sentence description of an event that happened that year.
1. **Famous Person (`find_famous_person`)**: A nested Workflow that first finds a person born in that year (`find_name`), and then forwards that name to another agent to write a biography (`generate_bio`).

From the perspective of the `root_agent` workflow, `find_famous_person` is just another node. The root workflow doesn't need to know the internal steps; it just waits for the parallel branches to finish, then synchronizes their outputs using a `JoinNode` before formatting them in `aggregate_results`.

## Sample Inputs

- `1969`
- `2000`
- `1984`

### Root Workflow (`root_agent`)

```text
                  [ START ]
                      |
                      v
               [process_input]
                 /         \
                /           \
               /             \
              v               v
[find_historical_event] [find_famous_person]
      (AGENT)               (WORKFLOW)
              \               /
               \             /
                \           /
                 v         v
           [join_for_aggregation]
                   (JOIN)
                     |
                     v
             [aggregate_results]
```

### Nested Workflow (`find_famous_person`)

```text
       [ START ]
           |
           v
      [find_name]
           |
           v
    [generate_bio]
```

## How To

1. Define your sub-workflow just like any regular workflow. Ensure it accepts the required state (e.g., `year`) and outputs the expected state (e.g., `person_bio`).

   ```python
   find_famous_person = Workflow(
       name="find_famous_person",
       edges=[("START", find_name, generate_bio)],
   )
   ```

1. Treat the sub-workflow as a normal node when defining the edges of the parent workflow. To run them concurrently, place the nodes in a tuple, then use a `JoinNode` to synchronize their parallel executions before the final aggregation.

   ```python
   root_agent = Workflow(
       name="root_agent",
       edges=[
           ("START", process_input, (find_famous_person, find_historical_event), join_for_aggregation, aggregate_results),
       ],
   )
   ```
