# ADK Workflow Routing Sample

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to use routing in **ADK Workflows**.

It takes user input and uses an LLM node to categorize it as a **question**, a **statement**, or **other**. Based on the classification, it appropriately routes the execution to a specialized agent or function to handle that specific type of input.

In ADK Workflows, **routing** allows conditionally executing different execution paths based on the output of a previous node.

## Sample Inputs

- `What is the capital of France?`
- `The weather is very nice today.`
- `Translate bonjour to english`

             [ classify_input ]
                      |
                      v
            [ route_on_category ]
               /      |      \
      "question" "statement"  "other"
             /        |        \
            v         v         v
[answer_question]     |  [handle_other]
                      |
           [comment_on_statement]
```

## How To

1. A node (agent or function) yields an `Event` with a specific route name:

   ```python
   yield Event(route="your_route_name")
   ```

1. In the `Workflow` edges definition, conditional edges are constructed using a routing map dict as the second element of the edge tuple:

   ```python
   (source_node, {"your_route_name": target_node})
   ```
