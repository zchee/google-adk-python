# This script is to update sessions DB that is created in previous ADK version,
# to schema that current ADK version use. The sample usage is in the samples/migrate_session_db.
#
# Usage:
# ./db_migration.sh "sqlite:///%(here)s/sessions.db" "google.adk.sessions.database_session_service"
# ./db_migration.sh "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/mydb" "google.adk.sessions.database_session_service"
# First argument is the sessions DB url.
# Second argument is the model import path.

# --- Configuration ---
ALEMBIC_DIR="alembic"
INI_FILE="alembic.ini"
ENV_FILE="${ALEMBIC_DIR}/env.py"
